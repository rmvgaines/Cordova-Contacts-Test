# Cordova-Contacts-Test
Apps making use of the Cordova Contacts Plugin fail pre-launch testing in the Google Play Developers Console. The app seems to crash on the HTC ONE (M8) test device when navigator.contacts.pickContact is called.

Both a test app that reproduces this problem and the pre-launch report generated by the Google Play Developers Console are included in this project.
